This will execute the program and display the output in the terminal.

Note: Make sure you have a C compiler (such as GCC) installed on your system.

Linux commands: cd [directory name] -> make -> ./math_stuff 

Usage:
- The program will prompt you for input at various stages, such as test numbers, values for printing prime numbers, finding Fibonacci numbers, and factoring numbers.
- Follow the instructions provided by the program and enter the requested input to see the results.

Important Note:
- Ensure that you are providing valid input, such as positive integers, when prompted by the program. Providing invalid input may result in unexpected behavior or errors.

Math Stuff
ECE 312
5 points (this is one of two parts for this assignment)

This is a lab where we used recursion to implement simple math functions. The algorithms to 
implement the math functions are easy, but we figured out how to make them recursive. 
In other words, we implemented all the functions WITHOUT USING ANY FOR OR WHILE LOOPS of any kind. 
We use any "helper" functions we needed, but still no loops!

We also implemented the following given functions:

- `bool isPrime(int number)`: Returns true if the number is prime, otherwise false.
- `void printPrimes(int n)`: Prints a list of prime numbers between 1 and n (inclusive).
- `int findFibo(int n)`: Returns the nth Fibonacci number.
- `void findFactors(int number)`: Prints the prime factors of the given number.

Note: The program must run in a Linux environment.

Turned in: One zipped file that includes: readme.txt (gives instructions for compiling and running code) and your source file(s). 
The makefile should create an executable program named "math_stuff". To make this process work better, zip the files on Linux before 
you transfer them back to your computer for the submission.
